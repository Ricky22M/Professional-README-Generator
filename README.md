# Professional-README-Generator

Want to create a fast, professional README.md file without having to do any of the hard-coding? Well you have come to the right place! Here I have created a project in which the user is able to create a professional README.md file with the use of the user input.

## How Does This Work?

As the user uses this application, the user will be prompted with questions asking the user about their project such as the name of the project, what the project is about, what purpose does the project fulfill, who collaberated on the project, ect. After the user answers all prompted questions, then a README.md file will be created instantly with their input being provided inside the README.md file, creating a professional README.md file for the user.

## User Story

```md
AS A developer
I WANT a README generator
SO THAT I can quickly create a professional README for a new project
```

## Acceptance Criteria

```md
GIVEN a command-line application that accepts user input
WHEN I am prompted for information about my application repository
THEN a high-quality, professional README.md is generated with the title of my project and sections entitled Description, Table of Contents, Installation, Usage, License, Contributing, Tests, and Questions
WHEN I enter my project title
THEN this is displayed as the title of the README
WHEN I enter a description, installation instructions, usage information, contribution guidelines, and test instructions
THEN this information is added to the sections of the README entitled Description, Installation, Usage, Contributing, and Tests
WHEN I choose a license for my application from a list of options
THEN a badge for that license is added near the top of the README and a notice is added to the section of the README entitled License that explains which license the application is covered under
WHEN I enter my GitHub username
THEN this is added to the section of the README entitled Questions, with a link to my GitHub profile
WHEN I enter my email address
THEN this is added to the section of the README entitled Questions, with instructions on how to reach me with additional questions
WHEN I click on the links in the Table of Contents
THEN I am taken to the corresponding section of the README
```
